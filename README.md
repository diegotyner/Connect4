# Connect Four Project
Project in order to familiarize myself with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
Used Socket.io in order to create client/server functionality.

Usage:
- A server has to run the main server side code and then clients can connect to the URL and create lobby codes to match themselves with other connect four players.
- Can use Ngrok to funnel a domain to an opened localhost port to play with people worldwide!
