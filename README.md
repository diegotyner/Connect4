# Connect Four Project
Project to familiarize myself with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
Used Socket.io in order to create client/server functionality.

Usage:
- Have to run the following in bash (in the project directory):
   - npm init
   - npm install -g nodemon
   - npm install --save express socket.io
   - Run with nodemon server/server.js

- A server has to run the main server-side code and then clients can connect to the URL and create lobby codes to match themselves with other connect four players.
- You can use Ngrok to funnel a domain to an opened localhost port to play with people worldwide!
